# 🐾 Cat vs. Dog Image Classifier

A machine learning project that classifies images of cats and dogs using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).  
> Utilizes a curated dataset of 25,000 labeled images of cats and dogs.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the development and deployment of a deep learning model to classify images as either a cat or a dog. It leverages CNN architecture, data augmentation, and transfer learning to improve accuracy and generalization. The application is deployed using Streamlit and hosted live on Hugging Face Spaces.

## 🧠 Steps Taken in Building the Application

- Developed a CNN-based image classification model.
- Employed **data augmentation** and **transfer learning** to enhance model performance.
- Trained the model using 80% of the dataset and reserved 20% for validation/testing.
- Evaluated the model’s performance on unseen test data.
- Built an interactive user interface using **Streamlit**.
- Deployed the application to **Hugging Face Spaces** for public access.
